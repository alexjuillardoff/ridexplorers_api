# ðŸŽ¢ RIDEXPLORERS API

RIDEXPLORERS API exposes a simple REST API containing data scraped from [RCDB](https://rcdb.com). It is built with **TypeScript** using **Express** and provides endpoints to query roller coasters and theme parks information.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Start the API**
   - Development: automatically recompiles and reloads using `nodemon`.
     ```bash
     npm run start:dev
     ```
   - Production: run the compiled JavaScript from `dist/`.
     ```bash
     npm run start:prod
     ```

### Scraping data
The API works with JSON files located under `src/db/`. These files are generated by scraping RCDB. Several npm scripts are provided:

- `npm run scrape` â€“ scrape coaster data between a range of IDs or pages and store it inside `src/db/coasters.json`. Images are mapped to an absolute URL with `scrape:map-coaster-photos`.
- `npm run scrape:theme-parks` â€“ scrape theme park information and save it to `src/db/theme-parks.json`.
- `npm run scrape:random` â€“ scrape a random set of coasters and store them in `src/db/random-coasters.json`.
- `npm run scrape:map-coaster-photos` â€“ map image URLs of previously scraped coasters to the configured RCDB base URL.

> **Note**: by default the RCDB base URL is `https://rcdb.com`. You can override it by setting the `RCDB_URL` environment variable.

## Endpoints

| HTTP Verb | Path                       | Description                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`     | `/` or `/api`              | List of available endpoints.                                                                     |
| `GET`     | `/api/coasters`            | Returns a paginated list of coasters. Use `offset` and `limit` query parameters.                 |
| `GET`     | `/api/coasters/:id`        | Returns coaster information by id. Returns `404` if not found.                                   |
| `GET`     | `/api/random-coasters`     | Returns the list of coasters scraped with `scrape:random`.                   |
| `GET`     | `/api/coasters/search?q=`  | Returns coasters whose name or park matches the `q` value.                                       |
| `GET`     | `/api/theme-parks`         | Returns a paginated list of theme parks. Use `offset` and `limit` query parameters.              |
| `GET`     | `/api/theme-parks/:id`     | Returns a theme park by id. Returns `400` if not found.                                          |

## Data files
- `src/db/coasters.json` â€“ all scraped coasters with mapped image URLs.
- `src/db/coasters-raw.json` â€“ raw coaster data before mapping images.
- `src/db/theme-parks.json` â€“ scraped theme park data.
- `src/db/random-coasters.json` â€“ results from `npm run scrape:random`.

Happy riding!
